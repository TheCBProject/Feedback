ChickenBones mods Feedback Repo.
================================
### Okay, so here's the deal.

This repository is for tracking bugs and providing suggestions for ALL of ChickenBones mods. It's far easier for us to check one place instead of 6 or 7. Use the issue tracker associated with this repository for bug reports and feature suggestions.

- The issue is practically guaranteed to be on your end. This is not tech support, please check the IRC. The link is below.
